Validating efficacy through comparison with established methods of detection is important for any new method. We used multi-method and single-method occupancy models to explore the effectiveness of 3 techniques for detecting northern leopard frogs (Lithobates pipiens) and boreal chorus frogs (Pseudacris maculata). We conducted surveys using automated recording units, environmental DNA sampling, and visual encounter surveys in spring (30 Apr-3 Jun) and summer (23 Jul-27 Aug) of 2014 at 68 sites in southern Alberta, Canada. The multi-method analysis incorporated data from all 3 survey methods while accounting for the lack of independence of detections within a sampling occasion, and we compared this to single-method analyses to explore occupancy biases associated with each method and differences in method-specific detection probability. Occupancy and detection probabilities estimated from environmental DNA analyses were biased for northern leopard frogs, overestimating probability of detection and underestimating occupancy. We could not assess bias for boreal chorus frogs because of overdispersion present in in the models. Although no single covariate explained this bias, it was ameliorated (albeit by reducing precision) by including a raw visual count of individuals as a proxy for abundance during the breeding but not the post-metamorphic season. These results emphasize the need for careful consideration of temporal and spatial aspects of sampling design, conducting pilot studies, and external validation of eDNA-only occupancy monitoring schemes prior to widespread implementation.","Calgary Zoo, Wilder Inst, 1300 Zoo Rd NE, Calgary, AB T2E 7V6, Canada",Washington State University,0022-541X,SEP,2023,87,7,,,10.1002/jwmg.22463,Jul-23,WOS:001022362200001,"['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2', 'Total Times Cited:  2', 'Cited Reference Count:  70']",,1,,1,1

For example, little research to date has evaluated how seasonality of organism behavior or activity may influence detection probability of eDNA. We applied eDNA to survey for two highly imperiled species endemic to the upper Black Warrior River basin in Alabama, US: the Black Warrior Water-dog (Necturus alabamensis) and the Flattened Musk Turtle (Sternotherus depressus). Importantly, these species have contrasting patterns of seasonal activity, with N. alabamensis more active in the cool season (October-April) and S. depressus more active in the warm season (May-September). We surveyed sites historically occupied by these species across cool and warm seasons over two years with replicated eDNA water samples, which were analyzed in the laboratory using species-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays. We then used occupancy estimation with detection probability modeling to evaluate both the effects of landscape attributes on organism presence and season of sampling on detection probability of eDNA. Importantly, we found that season strongly affected eDNA detection probability for both species, with N. alabamensis having higher eDNA detection probabilities during the cool season and S. depressus have higher eDNA detection probabilities during the warm season. These results illustrate the influence of organismal behavior or activity on eDNA detection in the environment and identify an important role for basic natural history in designing eDNA monitoring programs.","Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",University of Illinois System,1932-6203,24-Oct,2016,11,10,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0165273,,WOS:000389009200053,"['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  112', 'Total Times Cited:  142', 'Cited Reference Count:  58']",e0165273,1,,1,2

By analyzing amphibian species diversity on the Zhoushan Archipelago, the eDNA metabarcoding detected eight amphibian species on the islands and nine species in the mainland areas. Findings reveal that the amphibian species diversity is positively related to the island area. In comparison with the traditional line transect method, eDNA metabarcoding detected more amphibian species. eDNA showcases enormous potential in detecting amphibian species.Abstract The species-area relationship is important for understanding species diversity patterns at spatial scales, but few studies have examined the relationship using environmental DNA (eDNA) techniques. We investigated amphibian diversity on 21 islands of the Zhoushan Archipelago and nearby mainland areas in China using the combination of eDNA metabarcoding and the traditional line transect method (TLTM) and identified the species-area relationship for amphibians on the islands. The mean detection probability of eDNA is 0.54, while the mean detection probability of TLTM is 0.24. The eDNA metabarcoding detected eight amphibian species on the islands and nine species in the mainland areas, compared with seven species on the islands and nine species in the mainland areas that were identified by TLTM. Amphibian richness on the islands increased with island area and habitat diversity. The species-area relationship for amphibians in the archipelago was formulated as the power function (S = 0.47A0.21) or exponential function (S = 2.59 + 2.41 (logA)). Our results suggested that eDNA metabarcoding is more sensitive for the detection of amphibian species. The combined use of eDNA metabarcoding and the traditional line transect method may optimize the survey results for amphibians.","Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Anim Ecol & Conservat Biol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Sciences,2076-2615,JUN,2024,14,11,,,10.3390/ani14111519,,WOS:001245099400001,"['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1', 'Total Times Cited:  1', 'Cited Reference Count:  47']",1519,1,,1,3

These populations contain genetic diversity not found in Europe and are important to conservation efforts for the species which has declined across its range in Europe. Detection and monitoring of extant crucian carp populations are crucial for conservation success. Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis could be very useful in this respect as a rapid, cost-efficient monitoring tool. We developed a species-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay for eDNA surveillance of crucian carp to enable non-invasive, large-scale distribution monitoring. We compared fyke netting and eDNA analysis at ponds with (n = 10) and without (n = 10) crucian carp for presence-absence detection. We examined biotic (crucian carp density represented by catch-per-unit-effort [CPUE] estimate) and abiotic influences on eDNA detection probability using a hierarchical occupancy model, and eDNA quantification using a mixed-effects model. eDNA analysis achieved 90% detection for crucian carp (n = 10), failing in only one pond where presence was known. CPUE estimate and conductivity had positive and negative influences on eDNA detection probability in qPCR replicates respectively. Similarly, conductivity had a negative effect on DNA copy number, whereas copy number increased with CPUE estimate. Our results demonstrate that eDNA analysis could enable detection of crucian carp populations in ponds and benefit ongoing conservation efforts, but imperfect species detection in relation to biotic and abiotic factors and eDNA workflow requires further investigation. Nonetheless, we have established an eDNA framework for the crucian carp as well as sources of imperfect detection which future investigations can build upon.","Univ Hull, Sch Environm Sci, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England",University of Hull,0046-5070,JAN,2019,64,1,93,107,10.1111/fwb.13197,,WOS:000453853500008,"['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  34', 'Total Times Cited:  39', 'Cited Reference Count:  65']",,1,,1,4

We assessed the comparative efficacy of targeted eDNA detection via quantitative PCR (qPCR) and three conventional amphibian survey methods (visual encounter, breeding call, and larval dipnet surveys) for detecting nine anuran species in natural wetlands in southern Ontario, Canada. Our analyses revealed that all assessment methods yielded imperfect detection, with visual encounter and eDNA surveys detecting the greatest species richness and eDNA surveys requiring the fewest sampling events. Amphibian community composition results differed among survey methods and sampling events, and detection efficacy was markedly variable, with some species requiring two to three methods to maximize detection success. Notably, two relatively terrestrial species (Anaxyrus americanus and Hyla versicolor) had relatively low and seasonally variable eDNA detection rates, suggesting that species-specific ecology likely affects eDNA presence or detection.

Environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling has proven to be an effective method for detecting some invasive species, but comparisons between the detection probability of eDNA and traditional survey methods using modern occupancy modeling methods are rare. We developed a qPCR assay to detect two species of watersnake (Nerodia fasciata and Nerodia sipedon) introduced to California, USA, and we compared the efficacy of eDNA and aquatic trapping. We tested 3-9 water samples each from 30 sites near the known range of N. fasciata, and 61 sites near the known range of N. sipedon. We also deployed aquatic funnel traps at a subset of sites for each species. We detected N. fasciata eDNA in three of nine water samples from just one site, but captured N. fasciata in traps at three of ten sites. We detected N. sipedon eDNA in five of six water samples from one site, which was also the only site of nine at which this species was captured in traps. Traditional trapping surveys had a higher probability of detecting watersnakes than eDNA surveys, and both survey methods had higher detection probability for N. sipedon than N. fasciata. Occupancy models that integrated both trapping and eDNA surveys estimated that 5 sites (95% Credible Interval: 4-10) of 91 were occupied by watersnakes (both species combined), although snakes were only detected at four sites (three for N. fasciata, one for N. sipedon).

We sampled 40 sites (179 visual and 183 eDNA surveys) across the Ozark Highlands ecoregion. We estimated the detection probability of cave crayfishes and cavefishes using both survey methods under varying environmental conditions. The effectiveness of eDNA or visual surveys varied by environmental conditions (i.e., water volume, prevailing substrate, and water velocity) and the target taxa. When sampling in areas with average water velocity, no flow, and coarse substrate, eDNA surveys had a higher detection probability (0.49) than visual surveys (0.35) for cavefishes and visual surveys (0.67) had a higher detection probability than eDNA surveys (0.40) for cave crayfishes. Under the same sampling conditions, 5 visual surveys compared to 10 eDNA surveys would be needed to confidently detect cave crayfishes and 9 visual surveys compared to 4 eDNA surveys for cavefishes. Environmental DNA is a complementary tool to traditional visual surveys; however, the limitations we identified indicate eDNA currently cannot replace visual surveys in subterranean environments.

Only estimates of spatial variation were strongly correlated across the two sampling techniques. Environmental variables (water depth, rainfall, ambient temperature) were not clearly correlated with detection probabilities estimated via trapping, whereas eDNA detection probabilities were negatively correlated with water depth, possibly reflecting higher eDNA concentrations at lower water levels.

We paired conventional baited trapping as a measure of crayfish relative abundance with water samples for eDNA, which were analysed in the laboratory with a qPCR assay. We modelled detection probability for O. rusticus eDNA using relative abundance and site characteristics as covariates and also tested the relationship between eDNA copy number and O. rusticus relative abundance. 3. We detected O. rusticus eDNA in all lakes where this species was collected by trapping, down to low relative abundances, as well as in two lakes where trap catch was zero. Detection probability of O. rusticus eDNA was well predicted by relative abundance of this species and lake water clarity. However, there was poor correspondence between eDNA copy number and O. rusticus relative abundance estimated by trap catches. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates a field and laboratory protocol for eDNA monitoring of crayfish invasions, with results of statistical models that provide guidance of sampling effort and detection probabilities for researchers in other regions and systems. We propose eDNA be included as a tool in surveillance for invasive or imperilled crayfishes and other benthic arthropods.","Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Notre Dame,0021-8901,JUN,2016,53,3,722,732,10.1111/1365-2664.12621,,WOS:000380065400012,"['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  152', 'Total Times Cited:  180', 'Cited Reference Count:  49']",,0,,1,14

However, reptile populations are often difficult to monitor given the frequency of crypsis in their life history. This difficulty has left uncertain the conservation status of many species and the efficacy of conservation actions unknown. Environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys consistently elevate the detection rate of species they are designed to monitor, and while their use is promising for terrestrial reptile conservation, successes in developing such surveys have been sparse. We tested the degree to which inclusion of surface and soil eDNA sampling into conventional artificial-cover methods elevates the detection probability of a small, cryptic terrestrial lizard, Scincella lateralis. The eDNA sampling of cover object surfaces with paint rollers elevated per sample detection probabilities for this species 4-16 times compared with visual surveys alone. We readily detected S. lateralis eDNA under cover objects up to 2 weeks after the last visual detection, and at some cover objects where no S. lateralis were visually observed in prior months. With sufficient sampling intensity, eDNA testing of soil under cover objects produced comparable per sample detection probabilities as roller surface methods. Our results suggest that combining eDNA and cover object methods can considerably increase the detection power of reptile monitoring programs, allowing more accurate estimates of population size, detection of temporal and spatial changes in habitat use, and tracking success of restoration efforts. Further research into the deposition and decay rates of reptile eDNA under cover objects, as well as tailored protocols for different species and habitats, is needed to bring the technique into widespread use.","Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",Rutgers University System,0888-8892,DEC,2022,36,6,,,10.1111/cobi.13939,Aug-22,WOS:000846728700001,"['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  23', 'Total Times Cited:  24', 'Cited Reference Count:  46']",e13939,0,,1,15

Camera trapping and live trapping are commonly employed survey techniques, but they both have their limitations. Recently developed techniques such as adjusted short-focal camera trapping and environmental DNA (eDNA) are promising new approaches, but their relative performance remains poorly quantified. We compared the effectiveness of three survey protocols for detecting a semi-aquatic and elusive small mammal, the Eurasian water shrew (Neomys fodiens), by (1) short-focal camera trapping, (2) live trapping, and (3) soil eDNA. During September and October 2022, we surveyed 20 transects of each 100 m in length alongside the Kleine Dommel, a lowland brook in the Netherlands. The effectiveness of the three survey protocols was compared based on detection probabilities. Short-focal camera trapping yielded a significantly higher detection probability than the eDNA protocol. Detection probabilities between short-focal camera trapping and live trapping and, between the eDNA protocol and live trapping, were not significantly different. Short-focal camera trapping is an effective technique to survey Eurasian water shrews. Furthermore, this method detected additional species compared to live trapping and is non-invasive and less labour-intensive.

To help determine best survey practices for the species, we compared the effectiveness and efficiency of eDNA and camera traps in surveys for American mink. We used both methods to monitor the shoreline of seven bodies of water in northeastern Indiana from March to May 2021. We extracted DNA from filtered environmental water samples and used quantitative real-time PCR to determine the presence of mink at each site. We used Akaike's Information Criterion to rank probability of detection models with and without survey method as a covariate. We detected mink at four of the seven sites and seven of the 21 total survey weeks using camera traps (probability of detection (rho) = 0.36). We detected mink at five sites and during five survey weeks using eDNA (rho = 0.25). However, the highest probability of detection was obtained when both methods were combined, and data were pooled (rho = 0.47). Survey method did not influence model fit, suggesting no difference in detectability between camera traps and eDNA. Environmental DNA was twice as expensive, but only required a little over half (58%) of the time when compared to camera trapping. We recommend ways in which an improved eDNA methodology may be more cost effective for future studies.

In the Salish Sea (Washington, USA), pinto abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana) have failed to recover from intensive harvest after over 25 years of fishery closure, prompting a growing restoration effort. As these efforts expand, a persistent challenge is simply locating this rare and highly cryptic species in the field, limiting the ability to identify critical habitat and locate wild adults to serve as restoration broodstock. Here, we tested the use of environmental DNA (eDNA) to detect pinto abalone. Using a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay previously developed for larval pinto abalone, we first evaluated its sensitivity to abalone eDNA in aquaria settings, finding a positive relationship between abalone biomass and the concentration of abalone DNA. We then tested abalone eDNA detection in the field by collecting replicate water samples from abalone restoration sites, using an occupancy model to estimate detection probability in relation to abalone biomass estimated via diver surveys. Both eDNA concentration and detection probability were positively associated with diver-estimated abalone biomass. By modifying the assay for droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), detection probability increased by 32%-89% over qPCR. eDNA surveys using ddPCR had higher error (CV = 96.9%) than diver surveys (CV = 29.4%) but were more efficient, taking approximately 1/10th of the person-hours per site of a diver survey. For the final phase of the study, we collected water samples at 80 sites throughout the region, obtaining positive abalone eDNA detections at 11 sites with qPCR and 19 additional sites with ddPCR.

Here, we collected eDNA using filtration and glass fiber filter-based PEDS (submerged in water for 1 d) from 27 sites along the final reach of the Yangtze River and the coast of the Yellow Sea, followed by eDNA metabarcoding analysis of fish biodiversity and quantitative PCR (qPCR) for a critically endangered aquatic mammal, the Yangtze finless porpoise. We ultimately detected 98 fish species via eDNA metabarcoding. Both eDNA sampling methods captured comparable local species richness and revealed largely similar spatial variation in fish assemblages and community partitions between the river and sea sites. Notably, the Yangtze finless porpoise was detected only in the metabarcoding of eDNA collected by PEDS at five sites. Also, species-specific qPCR revealed that the PEDS captured porpoise eDNA at more sites (7 vs. 2), in greater quantities, and with a higher detection probability (0.803 vs. 0.407) than did filtration. Our results demonstrate the capacity of PEDS for surveying fish biodiversity, and support that continuous eDNA collection by PEDS can be more effective than instantaneous water sampling at capturing low abundance and ephemeral species in natural waters.

However, previous studies have generally only compared these two eDNA detection approaches for a single target species and have used different methodological and statistical approaches. Here we present a comparison of single- and multi-species eDNA detection methods, drawing on two published case studies (one fish, one amphibian) and two new extensive datasets on a freshwater mammal (the platypus). To ensure consistent conclusions regarding the sensitivity of each eDNA method, we use the same hierarchical site occupancy-detection model for each dataset, incorporating uncertainty at the site, water sample, and technical replicate level. Overall, qPCR achieved higher detection probabilities than metabarcoding across species and datasets. However, differences in sensitivity between detection methods varied depending on methodological decisions concerning what constitutes a true positive detection (i.e., qPCR and metabarcoding thresholds). The decision as to which eDNA detection method to use should always be influenced by the study aims, but our results suggest that single-species detection methods based on qPCR may be preferable when the aim is to achieve a high detection probability for target species.","Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,1574-9541,JUL,2023,75,,,,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102072,Apr-23,WOS:000978323200001,"['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17', 'Total Times Cited:  17', 'Cited Reference Count:  51']",102072,1,,0,21

Both the COI and 16S assays were highly specific for the targeted organism and showed similar accuracy and repeatability, whilst the limit of detection was clearly lower for the COI based approach.

I analysed the effect of three different sampling and extraction methods on eDNA yield, detection probability and PCR replication for detecting the endangered freshwater fish Macquaria australasica from water samples. The impact of eDNA concentration, PCR strategy, target amplicon size and two marker regions: 12S (a mitochondrial gene) and 18S (a nuclear gene) was also assessed.

The PCR replication effort required to achieve a detection probability of 0.95, ranged from 2 to 6 PCR replicates depending on the laboratory method used. As all methods yielded eDNA from which M. australasica was detected using the three target amplicons, differences in eDNA yield and detection probability between the three methods could be mitigated by determining the appropriate PCR replication effort.

The use of environmental DNA (eDNA) to detect species in aquatic environments such as ponds and streams is a powerful new technique with many benefits. However, species detection in eDNA-based surveys is likely to be imperfect, which can lead to underestimation of the distribution of a species. 2. Site occupancy models account for imperfect detection and can be used to estimate the proportion of sites where a species occurs from presence/absence survey data, making them ideal for the analysis of eDNA-based surveys. Imperfect detection can result from failure to detect the species during field work (e.g. by water samples) or during laboratory analysis (e.g. by PCR). 3. To demonstrate the utility of site occupancy models for eDNA surveys, we reanalysed a data set estimating the occurrence of the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis using eDNA. Our reanalysis showed that the previous estimation of species occurrence was low by 5-10%. Detection probability was best explained by an index of the number of hosts (frogs) in ponds. 4.

A simulation study showed that when using site occupancy analysis, researchers need many fewer samples to reliably estimate presence and absence of species than without use of site occupancy modelling. 5. Our analyses demonstrate the benefits of site occupancy models as a simple and powerful tool to estimate detection and site occupancy (species prevalence) probabilities despite imperfect detection. As species detection from eDNA becomes more common, adoption of appropriate statistical methods, such as site occupancy models, will become crucial to ensure that reliable inferences are made from eDNA-based surveys.","Karch, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland",University of Zurich,2041-210X,JUL,2013,4,7,646,653,10.1111/2041-210X.12052,,WOS:000329250300006,"['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  201', 'Total Times Cited:  236', 'Cited Reference Count:  49']",,0,,0,25

Monitoring of AIS using environmental DNA (eDNA) has the potential to enable broadscale surveillance at a fraction of the cost of conventional methods, but key questions must first be addressed related to how eDNA detection probability varies among environments, seasons, and multiple species with different life histories. To quantify spatiotemporal variation in the detection probability of AIS using eDNA sampling, we surveyed 20 lakes with known populations of four aquatic invasive species: common carp (Cyprinus carpio), rusty crayfish (Faxonius rusticus), spiny waterflea (Bythotrephes longimanus), and zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha). We collected water samples at 10 locations per lake, five times throughout the open water season resulting in a total of 1,000 water samples. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used with species-specific assays to determine the presence of each species' eDNA in water samples. With Bayesian occupancy models, we quantified the effects of lake and site characteristics and Julian date on eDNA detection probability. The probability of eDNA detection varied seasonally, and the seasonal variation was species-specific and related to species life histories. Zebra mussel eDNA was generally the most detectable among the species we targeted, and detection probability peaked in midsummer when only six water samples were required to achieve a 95% probability of detection (80% Bayesian credible interval: 3-12 samples). Spiny waterflea eDNA detections also peaked in mid to late summer, but were overall the most difficult species to detect, requiring 160 samples for a 95% probability of detection (80% Bayesian credible interval: 67-1,616 samples). Common carp eDNA was most detectable in the spring and rusty crayfish eDNA was most detectable in the early autumn, corresponding to key life history events.

Detection of environmental DNA (eDNA) is a promising method towards significantly increasing large-scale herpetological conservation efforts. However, the integration of eDNA results within a management framework requires an evaluation of the efficiency of the method in large natural environments and the calibration of eDNA surveys with the quantitative monitoring tools currently used by conservation biologists. Towards this end, we first developed species-specific primers to detect the wood turtle (Glyptemys insculpta) a species at risk in Canada, by quantitative PCR (qPCR). The rate of eDNA detection obtained by qPCR was also compared to the relative abundance of this species in nine rivers obtained by standardized visual surveys in the Province of Quebec (Canada). Second, we developed multi-species primers to detect North American amphibian and reptile species using eDNA metabarcoding analysis. An occurrence index based on the distribution range and habitat type was compared with the eDNA metabarcoding dataset from samples collected in seven lakes and five rivers. Our results empirically support the effectiveness of eDNA metabarcoding to characterize herpetological species distributions. Moreover, detection rates provided similar results to standardized visual surveys currently used to develop conservation strategies for the wood turtle. We conclude that eDNA detection rates may provide an effective semiquantitative survey tool, provided that assay calibration and standardization is performed.","Univ Laval, Inst Biol Integrat & Syst, Pavillon Charles Eugene Marchand, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada",Laval University,0831-2796,NOV,2016,59,11,991,1007,10.1139/gen-2015-0218,,WOS:000388095000009,"['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  58', 'Total Times Cited:  71', 'Cited Reference Count:  89']",,0,,0,27

The general consensus is that eDNA methods are more accurate and cost-effective than traditional survey methods. However, they are formally approved for just a few species globally (e.g., Bighead Carp, Silver Carp, Great Crested Newt). We conducted a meta-analysis of studies that directly compare eDNA with traditional surveys to evaluate the assertion that eDNA methods are consistently ""better."" Environmental DNA publications for multiple species or single macro-organism detection were identified using the Web of Science, by searching ""eDNA"" and ""environmental DNA"" across papers published between 1970 and 2020. The methods used, focal taxa, habitats surveyed, and quantitative and categorical results were collated and analyzed to determine whether and under what circumstances eDNA outperforms traditional surveys. Results show that eDNA methods are cheaper, more sensitive, and detect more species than traditional methods. This is, however, taxa-dependent, with amphibians having the highest potential for detection by eDNA survey. Perhaps most strikingly, of the 535 papers reviewed just 49 quantified the probability of detection for both eDNA and traditional survey methods and studies were three times more likely to give qualitative statements of performance. Synthesis and applications: The results of this meta-analysis demonstrate that where there is a direct comparison, eDNA surveys of macro-organisms are more accurate and efficient than traditional surveys. This conclusion, however, is based on just a fraction of available eDNA papers as most do not offer this granularity. We recommend that conclusions are substantiated with comparable and quantitative data. Where a direct comparison has not been made, we caution against the use of qualitative statements about relative performance. This consistency and rigor will simplify how the eDNA research community tracks methods-based advances and will also provide greater clarity for conservation practitioners.

We assayed water samples from streams presumed likely to be occupied or unoccupied by RLP based on previous fish surveys.

We detected RLP eDNA at 11 of 12 sites in occupied streams and no sites in presumed-unoccupied streams. In best-supported models, detection was positively related to an index of fish density, whereas other environmental factors had no consistent effects.

We show how methods that account for imperfect and stochastic detection can be used to (i) determine the optimal allocation of survey effort with eDNA sampling for a fixed budget (i.e. identify the optimal combination of water samples vs. site visits), and (ii) assess the cost-efficiency of eDNA sampling relative to traditional survey techniques. We illustrate this approach by comparing eDNA sampling and bottle-trapping for an exotic newt species (Lissotriton v. vulgaris) recently detected in Melbourne, Australia. Bottle traps produced much lower detection rates than eDNA sampling, but the cost-efficiency of the two methods can be similar because bottle-trapping is cheaper per sample. The relative cost-efficiency of the two sampling methods was sensitive to the available survey budget, the costs of eDNA primer/probe development and sample processing and the number of positive quantitative PCR assays (qPCRs) used to designate a water sample as positive for newt DNA. Environmental DNA sampling was more cost-efficient than bottle-trapping for small to intermediate budgets when primer/probe development and sample processing costs were low, and 1/4 or 2/4 positive qPCRs were used to label a water sample as positive for newt eDNA. However, bottle traps were generally more cost-efficient than eDNA sampling when primer/probe development and sample processing costs were high, regardless of qPCR threshold or survey budget. Traditional sampling methods may achieve lower detection probabilities compared to eDNA sampling, but the totality of costs can make eDNA sampling less efficient than traditional techniques in some circumstances. Our approach provides a quantitative framework for determining how many water samples and site visits are required to maximize detection probabilities with eDNA sampling, and can calculate the cost-efficiency of any sampling method.","Univ Melbourne, Sch Biosci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,2041-210X,NOV,2016,7,11,1291,1298,10.1111/2041-210X.12598,,WOS:000387669600004,"['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  111', 'Total Times Cited:  131', 'Cited Reference Count:  35']",,0,,0,30

Here, we analyse this comprehensive dataset (280 sites across all France; 40 species) to investigate detection probabilities, infer species distributions and reassess conservation status, and finally examine community patterns (richness) and their determinants. Our method gave over 95 % probability of detection for most species. Species distributions inferred from eDNA sampling were compared with currently known distributions. Four invasive species and one species of conservation concern were found outside their known range. Others were found in a surprisingly small number of localities, although they are currently thought to be widespread and not of conservation concern. Indeed, the databases currently used to determine conservation status are biased by the inclusion of old data, mainly based on shell records only, and may include misidentified species. The main drivers of species richness were latitude and distance from the spring. Co-occurrence of species was investigated for the first time.

Detection of both aquatic and sedimentary eDNA varied through the year, peaking in the summer (July), with its lowest point in the winter (January): in all seasons, detection probability of eDNA from water exceeded that from sediment. Detection probability of eDNA also varied between study areas, and according to great crested newt habitat suitability and sediment type.

Previous research suggests that eDNA methods are substantially more sensitive than traditional sampling. However, the factors influencing eDNA detection and the resulting sampling costs are still not well understood. Here we use multiple experiments to derive independent estimates of eDNA production rates and downstream persistence from brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) in streams. We use these estimates to parameterize models comparing the false negative detection rates of eDNA sampling and traditional backpack electrofishing. We find that using the protocols in this study eDNA had reasonable detection probabilities at extremely low animal densities (e.g., probability of detection 0.18 at densities of one fish per stream kilometer) and very high detection probabilities at population-level densities (e.g., probability of detection >0.99 at densities of >= 3 fish per 100 m). This is substantially more sensitive than traditional electrofishing for determining the presence of brook trout and may translate into important cost savings when animals are rare. Our findings are consistent with a growing body of literature showing that eDNA sampling is a powerful tool for the detection of aquatic species, particularly those that are rare and difficult to sample using traditional methods.

Previous eDNA applications to lotic ecosystems have shown promise in accurately inferring species presence, although studies attempting to estimate species abundance have had mixed results. This may be because eDNA applications in lotic environments are challenged by directional streamflow, which has the potential to transport detectable eDNA downstream from its source. Our study sought to evaluate whether results from eDNA corresponded well with the presence and abundance of the narrowly endemic, large river specialist crayfish Faxonius eupunctus obtained through a rigorous, well-tested conventional sampling method, or instead, if downstream eDNA transport in this large river system might overwhelm the effect of local species abundance. We used a species-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay to amplify F.eupunctus eDNA collected in surface water samples from streus eDams within the Eleven Point River drainage, Arkansas and Missouri, U.S.A. We estimated F.eupunctNA detection probabilities and examined relationships between eDNA detection probability and site-scale variables using a hierarchical occupancy and detection probability modelling framework. Results from eDNA sampling showed 90% agreement relative to our conventional sampling method in estimating F.eupunctus presence, although eDNA failed to detect F.eupunctus eDNA at two upstream sites where conventional sampling detected F.eupunctus individuals. We found a poor relationship between F.eupunctus eDNA detection probability and local F.eupunctus abundance, and a strong relationship between eDNA detection probability and upstream river distance, which we used as a proxy for the risk of downstream transport of eDNA from upstream F.eupunctus populations. Our results demonstrate eDNA is a largely reliable tool for estimating the presence of benthic organisms in large, freshwater rivers. However, the likelihood of detecting F.eupunctus eDNA presence in our study increased as we moved down the stream network, even though local species abundances were greatest at more upstream locations. Therefore, the ability of eDNA to accurately reflect species presence or abundance in some lotic environments may be hindered by the downstream transport of detectable eDNA.","Univ Illinois, Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Prairie Res Inst, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",University of Illinois System,0046-5070,MAY,2018,63,5,443,455,10.1111/fwb.13081,,WOS:000428995400004,"['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  45', 'Total Times Cited:  54', 'Cited Reference Count:  74']",,0,,0,35

However, before widespread adoption is feasible, the efficiency and logistics of roller sample collection and study design, especially relative to realistic survey conditions, must be evaluated.

Additionally, we evaluated how the detection probability of our target species, the spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula), varied with sampling effort (time spent rolling per sample) and the initial quantity of eDNA present.

We found storing rollers with ethanol or cold temperatures resulted in 3-10-fold greater concentrations of experimentally controlled eDNA relative to no treatment after 24 h. Detection probability declined as the amount of lanternfly eDNA decreased, but did not change in response to sampling effort over sample time (10-80 s/tree). Finally, recovered lanternfly eDNA decreased as more trees were sampled by a single roller-a 91% reduction after 7 trees-potentially due to captured DNA being transferred back from the roller onto the bark.

In aquatic systems, eDNA can be transported out either horizontally in water flows or vertically by incorporation into the sediment. Equally, eDNA may be broken down by various biotic and abiotic processes if the target organism leaves the system. We use occupancy modelling and a replicated mesocosm experiment to examine how detection probability of eDNA changes once the target species is no longer present. We hypothesise that detection probability falls faster with a sediment which has a large number of DNA binding sites such as topsoil or clay, over lower DNA binding capacity substrates such as sand. Water removed from ponds containing the target species (the great crested newt) initially showed high detection probabilities, but these fell to between 40% and 60% over the first 10 days and to between 10% and 22% by day 15: eDNA remained detectable at very low levels until day 22. Very little difference in detection was observed between the control group (no substrate) and the sand substrate. A small reduction in detection probability was observed between the control and clay substrates, but this was not significant. However, a highly significant reduction in detection probability was observed with a topsoil substrate. This result is likely to have stemmed from increased levels of PCR inhibition, suggesting that incorporation of DNA into the sentiment is of only limited importance.

One confounding factor when interpreting eDNA sampling evidence is that eDNA can be present in the water in the absence of living target organisms, originating from excreta, dead tissue, boats, or sewage effluent, etc. In the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS), electric fish dispersal barriers were built to prevent non-native Asian carp species from invading Lake Michigan, and yet Asian carp eDNA has been detected above the barriers sporadically since 2009. In this paper the influence of stream flow characteristics in the CAWS on the probability of invasive Asian carp eDNA detection in the CAWS from 2009 to 2012 was examined. In the CAWS, the direction of stream flow is mostly away from Lake Michigan, though there are infrequent reversals in flow direction towards Lake Michigan during dry spells. We find that the flow reversal volume into the Lake has a statistically significant positive relationship with eDNA detection probability, while other covariates, like gage height, precipitation, season, water temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, pH and chlorophyll concentration do not. This suggests that stream flow direction is highly influential on eDNA detection in the CAWS and should be considered when interpreting eDNA evidence. We also find that the beta-binomial regression model provides a stronger fit for eDNA detection probability compared to a binomial regression model. This paper provides a statistical modeling framework for interpreting eDNA sampling evidence and for evaluating covariates influencing eDNA detection. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

While eDNA techniques have been used to detectBatrachochytriumDNA in the environment, a systematic comparison of extraction methods across environmental samples is lacking. In this study, we first compared eDNA extraction methods and found that a soil extraction kit (Qiagen PowerSoil) was the most effective for detectingBatrachochytrium dendrobatidisin water samples. The PowerSoil extraction had a minimum detection level of 100 zoospores and had a two- to four-fold higher detection probability than other commonly used extraction methods (e.g., QIAamp extraction, DNeasy+Qiashredder extraction method, respectively). Next, we used this extraction method on field-collected water and sediment samples and were able to detect pathogen DNA in both. While field-collected water filters were equivalent to amphibian skin swab samples in detecting the presence of pathogen DNA, the seasonal patterns in pathogen quantity were different between skin swabs and water samples. Detection rate was lowest in sediment samples. We also found that detection probability increases with the volume of water filtered. Our results indicate that water filter eDNA samples can be accurate in detecting pathogen presence at the habitat scale but their utility for quantifying pathogen loads in the environment appears limited.

Environmental DNA offers unprecedented opportunities for this aim but several challenges still need to be addressed before implementing efficient species monitoring using eDNA. One of them is optimizing the eDNA sampling scheme to maximize the eDNA detection probability. For instance, in flowing freshwaters, the transport of eDNA downstream from its source can impact the eDNA detection probability, and blur the link between eDNA detection and the local occurrence of the species. Here, we investigated the eDNA spatial range of Harttiella lucifer (Siluriformes, Loricariidae), a threatened neotropical siluriform fish inhabiting French Guianese mountain streams, and confined to waterfalls and fast-flowing environments. Environmental samples were collected at 11 sites from the H. lucifer population to 2000 m downstream. A species-specific dPCR approach was applied to quantify the amount of DNA present in each sample and evaluate the eDNA detection probability of H. lucifer according to the distance from its source. Results showed an accumulation of eDNA at 50 and 100 m downstream from H. lucifer population. The evaluation of detection probabilities revealed that 300 m downstream from H. lucifer population, the probability of detection drops to 50%. This study suggests that eDNA drift in neotropical small streams is limited to a few tens meters downstream. These findings demonstrate that in neotropical small streams, eDNA provides a picture of the local fish fauna rather than integrating information over large spatial scales.","Univ Toulouse Paul Sabatier 3 UT3, Univ Toulouse, Ctr Rech Biodivers & Environm CRBE, CNRS,UMR5300,IRD,Toulouse INP, Toulouse, France",Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE),1541-5856,SEP,2024,22,9,660,669,10.1002/lom3.10634,Jul-24,WOS:001261503400001,"['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0', 'Total Times Cited:  0', 'Cited Reference Count:  40']",,0,,0,43

Monitoring of feral swine populations requires expensive and labor-intensive techniques such as aerial surveys, field surveys for sign, trail cameras, and verifying landowner reports. Environmental DNA (eDNA) provides an alternative method for locating feral swine. To aid in detection of this harmful invasive species, a novel assay was developed incorporating molecular methods. From August 2017 to April 2018, water samples and stream data were collected along 400 m transects in two different stream types where swine DNA was artificially introduced to investigate potential factors affecting detection. A generalized linear model (family binomial) was used to characterize environmental conditions affecting swine DNA detection; detection was the dependent variable and stream measurements included stream type, distance downstream, water temperature, velocity, turbidity, discharge, and pH as independent variables. Parameters from the generalized linear model were deemed significant if 95% confidence intervals did not overlap 0.

The cumulative detection probability of Bd eDNA at a pond decreased from May through July 2017 because there was a de crease in the probability of detecting eDNA in qPCR reactions.

Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is a powerful tool to estimate biodiversity in poorly known environments and has excellent performance for soil organisms. Here, we tested 1) whether eDNA metabarcoding from cave soils/sediments allows to successfully detect springtails (Hexapoda: Collembola) and insects (Hexapoda: Insecta); 2) whether eDNA mostly represents autochthonous (cave-dwelling) organisms or it also incorporates information from species living in surface environments; 3) whether eDNA detection probability changes across taxa with different ecology. Environmental DNA metabarcoding analyses detected a large number of Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) for both insects and springtails. For springtails, detection probability was high, with a substantial proportion of hypogean species, suggesting that eDNA provides good information on the distribution of these organisms in caves. Conversely, for insects most of MOTUs represented taxa living outside caves, and the majority of them represented taxa/organisms living in freshwater environments (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera). The eDNA of freshwater insects was particularly abundant in deep sectors of caves, far from the entrance. Furthermore, average detection probability of insects was significantly lower than the one of springtails. This suggests that cave soils/sediments act as ""conveyer belts of biodiversity information"", possibly because percolating water lead to the accumulation of eDNA of organisms living in nearby areas. Cave soils hold a complex mix of autochthonous and allochthonous eDNA. eDNA provided unprecedented information on the understudied subterranean cave organisms; analyses of detection probability and occupancy can help teasing apart local eDNA from the eDNA representing spatially-integrated biodiversity for whole landscape.","Rudjer Boskovic Inst, Div Mol Biol, Zagreb, Croatia",Rudjer Boskovic Institute,0048-9697,20-Jun,2022,826,,,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154022,Mar-22,WOS:000790514000013,"['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17', 'Total Times Cited:  18', 'Cited Reference Count:  89']",154022,0,,0,47
